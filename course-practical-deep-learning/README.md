# [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/)
Free course for coders to learn deep learning and machine learning for practical problems

They teach "“top down”: start with complete useful solutions to real world problems, and gradually work down to the basic foundations. Education experts recommend this approach for more effective learning."

Their incentive to teach this is they offer an [Amazon Book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch-ebook-dp-B08C2KM7NR/dp/B08C2KM7NR
) and an open-source deep learning library built on PyTorch to simplify training neural networks called `fastai`.
