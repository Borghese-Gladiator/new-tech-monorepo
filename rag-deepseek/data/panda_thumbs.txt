Giant pandas have a special adaptation called a "pseudo-thumb."
This extra thumb is actually an extended wrist bone that helps them grip bamboo while eating.
Unlike a true opposable thumb, it is not flexible but provides a strong hold.
This adaptation allows pandas to efficiently strip bamboo leaves and eat up to 40 kg per day.
