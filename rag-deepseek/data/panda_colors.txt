A pandaâ€™s black-and-white fur pattern serves as both camouflage and communication.
The black fur helps them blend into shadows in dense forests, while the white fur blends with snow.
Scientists believe their unique coloring helps avoid predators and recognize each other.
Unlike many other bears, pandas do not change fur color with the seasons.
