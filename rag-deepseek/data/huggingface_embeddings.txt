Hugging Face Embeddings provide pre-trained models for generating text embeddings.
These embeddings convert text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning.
They are commonly used in NLP applications like search, retrieval, and recommendation systems.
Popular models for embeddings include BERT, RoBERTa, and Sentence Transformers.
